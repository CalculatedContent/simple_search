ClickTracker is a meant to be deoloyed via the chef capistrano-like sinatra_app recipe

ClickTracker is a simple Sinatra app that collects clicks from a user website,
stores some basic information in Redis, and provides very crude 'related link"
recommendations
 
It is my example of how to do recommendations with nearly and only 1 page of code, end to end
